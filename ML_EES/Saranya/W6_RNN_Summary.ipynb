    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Sequential Data Handling:\n",
    "RNNs are designed to work with sequential data where the order of data points matters.\n",
    "Examples in environmental science include time series data (e.g., weather observations, pollution levels, and ocean currents) and sequences of sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. Recurrent Neurons:\n",
    "RNNs have neurons with recurrent connections, meaning they can maintain a form of memory of previous time steps.\n",
    "This memory enables RNNs to process sequences and make predictions based on prior data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. The Time Dimension:\n",
    "RNNs introduce the time dimension into neural networks, allowing them to process data across different time steps.\n",
    "This is crucial for tasks like forecasting environmental changes or modeling long-term climate patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4. Vanishing and Exploding Gradients:\n",
    "RNNs are prone to gradient-related issues due to backpropagation through time. This can cause vanishing gradients (gradients become too small) or exploding gradients (gradients become too large).\n",
    "Techniques like LSTM and GRU cells were developed to address these issues.\n"

    "### Environmental Science Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Weather Forecasting:\n",
    "RNNs can analyze historical weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure) to make short-term and long-term weather predictions.\n",
    "For example, they can be used to predict daily or hourly temperature changes, supporting applications like agriculture and disaster management.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. Air Quality Prediction:\n",
    "RNNs can be employed to forecast air quality based on a sequence of meteorological data, historical pollution levels, and emission sources.\n",
    "These models help in predicting pollution trends and alerting the public about potential health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. Ocean Current Modeling:\n",
    "RNNs can analyze historical ocean current data to understand and predict oceanic patterns and behavior.\n",
    "This knowledge is essential for applications like navigation, fisheries management, and marine conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4. Climate Change Modeling:\n",
    "RNNs can be used to model long-term climate data, including temperature, sea levels, and greenhouse gas concentrations.\n",
    "These models help in predicting future climate scenarios and assessing the impact of climate change on ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 5. Natural Language Processing for Environmental Texts:\n",
    "In NLP, RNNs can analyze text data related to environmental science, such as research papers or environmental reports.\n",
    "They assist in tasks like sentiment analysis of public opinions on environmental issues or summarizing scientific research."

    "> 1. Tokenization:\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual units or tokens, often words or phrases.\n",
    "Use in Environmental Sciences: Tokenization helps transform unstructured text data into a structured format for analysis. For instance, breaking a climate report into tokens allows for sentiment analysis.\n",

    "Stop words are common words (e.g., \"the,\" \"and,\" \"in\") that are often removed during text processing as they carry little meaning.\n",
    "Use in Environmental Sciences: Removing stop words can improve the efficiency of text analysis by focusing on content-bearing words.\n",

    "Text vectorization is the process of converting text data into numerical representations (vectors).\n",

    "\n",
    "> 4. Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text.\n",
    "Use in Environmental Sciences: Assessing public sentiment toward environmental policies or climate change through the analysis of news articles and social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 5. Named Entity Recognition (NER):\n",
    "NER is a technique used to identify and classify named entities (e.g., locations, organizations, persons) in text.\n",
