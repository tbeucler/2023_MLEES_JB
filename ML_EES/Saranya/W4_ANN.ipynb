They can model complex functions using exponentially fewer neurons than shallow networks. This efficiency enables deep networks to achieve better performance with the same amount of training data.\n",

Lower layers capture low-level structures (e.g., line segments), intermediate layers combine these to model intermediate-level structures (e.g., shapes), and the highest layers model high-level structures (e.g., faces).
