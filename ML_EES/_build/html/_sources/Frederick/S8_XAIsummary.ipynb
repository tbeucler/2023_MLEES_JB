        "The first question we need to ask ourselves is \"do we really need a model to the interpretable?\" This question stems from the **trade-offs** between predictive accuracy and model interpretability. A MLR model is often less accurate than complex neural networks for complex problems. Neural networks are too complex to be directly interpretable, however.\n",

By analyzing how machine learning models make predictions, we may get some new understanding on, e.g., what differentiates premium wines to cheap ones? It is also possible to use tools to leverage interpretability to extract knowledge embedded in machine learning models (**Extract Additional Insights**)\n",
