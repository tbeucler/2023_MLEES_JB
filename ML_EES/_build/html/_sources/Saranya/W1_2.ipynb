    "**Cost Function :**\n",
    " Cost Function quantifies how well a machine learning model's predictions align with the actual target values. It measures the discrepancy between the predicted values generated by the model and the true values from the training dataset. The objective of a machine learning algorithm is to minimize this cost function, which essentially means improving the model's accuracy and precision in making predictions.\n",

    "### Linear Regression:\n",
    "Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous numerical output based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the inputs and the target variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual target values. The most common cost function used in linear regression is the Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is an extension of linear regression that deals with multiple input features. Instead of just one input, there are multiple independent variables influencing the target variable. The algorithm estimates the coefficients for each feature, determining their individual impact on the target variable while considering their interrelationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Regression Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Polynomial Regression: This type of regression extends linear regression to capture nonlinear relationships by introducing polynomial terms of the input features. It fits a curve to the data instead of a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Ridge regression adds a regularization term to the linear regression cost function. It helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficient values, thus promoting simpler models.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Similar to ridge regression, lasso regression also adds a regularization term. However, it uses the absolute values of coefficients, often resulting in some coefficients being exactly zero. This leads to feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Elastic Net Regression: Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 regularization to balance the strengths of both. It can handle situations where there are correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR applies the principles of support vector machines to regression problems. It aims to fit a hyperplane that captures as many instances within a specified margin as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Decision Tree Regression: Similar to classification decision trees, decision tree regression predicts a continuous target value by partitioning the feature space into regions and assigning the average target value of instances within each region.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Random Forest Regression: An ensemble method combining multiple decision tree regressors. It improves predictive accuracy and reduces overfitting by averaging the predictions of individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Gradient Boosting Regression: A boosting technique that builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise manner. It combines the predictions of weak learners (often decision trees) to create a strong predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each regression method has its own strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to different types of data and problem domains. The choice of which method to use depends on the nature of the data, the problem's requirements, and the desired level of interpretability and predictive accuracy."
