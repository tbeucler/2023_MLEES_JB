        "**Linear regression** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for **predicting a continuous numerical output** based on one or more input features.

The most common cost function used in linear regression is the *Mean Squared Error* (MSE).\n",

        "\n",
        ">>  **Lasso Regression** (L1 Regularization): Similar to ridge regression, lasso regression also adds a regularization term. However, it uses the absolute values of coefficients, often resulting in some coefficients being exactly zero. This leads to feature selection.\n",
