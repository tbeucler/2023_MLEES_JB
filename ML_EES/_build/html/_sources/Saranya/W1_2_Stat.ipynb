It relies on the assumption that historical patterns and relationships observed in the data will continue into the future. They play a crucial role in environmental science for analyzing complex datasets, identifying patterns, and making informed decisions related to environmental monitoring, management, and projections. They help researchers extract valuable insights from environmental data and support evidence-based decision-making."

    "Temporal dependency in statistical forecasting is a fundamental concept that underscores the inherent relationship between data points in a time series. As phenomena observed in a time series get closer in time, they tend to exhibit a stronger connection and dependence than those further apart. This notion is crucial in understanding the dynamics of time series data and forms the bedrock of forecasting methodologies. When dealing with time series forecasting, it becomes apparent that forecasting events or values closer in time often results in considerably less variability and, consequently, higher accuracy than attempting predictions further into the future. This principle echoes the idea that phenomena evolve over time and are influenced by recent observations. Therefore, considering temporal dependency is essential when delving into time series analysis, as it provides valuable insights into the patterns and trends that can drive accurate forecasts, making it a vital concept in the field of statistical forecasting."

    "\n",
    "> Collect Observation Data: Concurrently, actual weather observations are collected from weather stations, satellites, radars, and other sources. These observations serve as ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Develop Statistical Relationships: MOS techniques involve developing statistical relationships between the model output and observed data. These relationships can be simple linear regressions, more complex statistical models, or machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Apply Corrections: The statistical relationships developed in step 3 are applied to correct the raw model output. For example, if the model consistently predicts temperatures that are too high, the MOS equations adjust the model's temperature forecasts downward.\n",

    "> Produce Improved Forecasts: The corrected model output, now enhanced by MOS, provides more accurate and reliable forecasts. These improved forecasts are then used for weather predictions and advisories.\n",
